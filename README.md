# Crow

Crow is a desktop application built with React and Electron that provides users with a customizable dashboard for storing macros and functions. The application allows users to add various "widgets" to their dashboard, each offering additional features and functionality.

## Features

- **Macro Storage**: Crow allows users to store and manage macros and functions for easy access and reuse. Users can create, edit, and delete macros within the application.

- **Widgets**: The dashboard supports the addition of widgets, which are specialized components that provide specific functionality. Currently, Crow offers the following widgets:

  - **To-Do List**: A to-do list widget that enables users to manage their tasks and includes a notification system to remind users of upcoming deadlines or events.

  - **Weather**: A weather widget that fetches weather information using the Weatherbit API. Users can view current weather conditions, forecasts, and other related information.

  - **Gmail**: An authentication-enabled widget that allows users to view their Gmail inbox, read and compose emails, and manage their email account directly within Crow.
